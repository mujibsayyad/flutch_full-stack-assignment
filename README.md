## Project Setup

Please follow the instructions below to setup the project:

### Clone the Repository

First, we need to clone the repository. Open your terminal, navigate to your desired directory, and run the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/mujibsayyad/flutch_full-stack-assignment.git
```

### Navigate into the Project Directory

Once cloning is complete, navigate into the new project directory with this command:

```
cd book-store
```

### For Front-End (Next.js)

> To work with frontend and run navigate to client directory

> ```
> cd client
> ```
>
> `Use default keyword of your package manager to run project` `e.x npm / yarn / pnpm`

### Install Dependencies

Now we'll install the project's dependencies. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. To install the dependencies, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

or
